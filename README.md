# Solana Trading Bot

This Solana Trading Bot is designed to automate token swaps between SOL and a specified SPL token (commonly referred to as a "meme coin"). The bot leverages Solana's decentralized exchanges (DEXes), such as Raydium, to execute trades and manage token accounts.

## Features

- **Automated Trading**: Executes continuous trading cycles, buying and selling a specified SPL token using SOL.
- **Customizable Trading Parameters**: Configure buy amounts, sell percentages, slippage, and timing between trades.
- **Dynamic Pool Lookup**: Automatically finds the appropriate liquidity pool for the SOL/meme coin pair.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling ensures smooth operation and provides informative logging.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Solana CLI**: You need to have the Solana CLI installed and configured on your machine. Follow the instructions on [Solana's official documentation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-trading-bot.git
cd solana-trading-bot
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Wallet

- Save your Solana wallet's secret key as a JSON file (e.g., `new_wallet.json`) in a secure location.
- Update the `WALLET_PATH` constant in `sol-baseline-bot.mjs` to point to your wallet file.

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

You can create a `.env` file to manage environment variables such as API endpoints or custom configurations. For now, the bot uses hardcoded paths and parameters.

### Step 5: Customize Trading Parameters

Open `sol-baseline-bot.mjs` and update the constants to suit your trading strategy:

- `TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS`: Public key of the meme coin you want to trade.
- `MAX_BUY_AMOUNT` and `MIN_BUY_AMOUNT`: Configure the range of SOL amounts to use for buying.
- `SELL_PERCENTAGE`: Percentage of your meme coin holdings to sell.
- `TIME_BETWEEN_TRADES`: Interval between each trading cycle.
- `SLIPPAGE`: Maximum acceptable slippage for trades.

## Running the Bot

Once you've configured the bot, you can start it by running:

```bash
node sol-baseline-bot.mjs
```

The bot will continuously execute trading cycles, buying the specified SPL token with SOL and then selling it back to SOL, with random delays between buy operations.

## Project Structure

- **`sol-baseline-bot.mjs`**: The main script that handles the trading loop and executes buy/sell operations.
- **`lib.js`**: Contains helper functions for interacting with the Solana blockchain, managing token accounts, and performing swaps.
- **`package.json`**: Manages the project's dependencies.

## Future Improvements

As you gain experience, consider adding the following features:

- **Advanced Trading Strategies**: Implement limit orders, stop-loss mechanisms, or dynamic trade execution based on market data.
- **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly CLI or GUI to configure and monitor the bot.
- **Integration with Price Feeds**: Use oracles or APIs to make informed trading decisions.
- **Automated Testing**: Add testing scripts to simulate trading scenarios and validate the bot's logic.
